<h1>Creamy Chocolate Fudge</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This is what I like to call “shortcut fudge”, because the method doesn’t require a candy thermometer or tons of stirring. Instead the method is super simple and straightforward. You’ll simply combine the chocolate chips, butter, and condensed milk into a large heatproof glass bowl. Then place the bowl over a large bowl of gently simmering water. Essentially you’re making a double-boiler.</p>

<p>Once the chocolate and butter have completely melted, you’ll remove it from heat and stir in the vanilla.</p>

<p>The mixture will be very thick! Use a strong spatula to scrape the fudge mixture into the prepared pan and smooth the top.</p>

<p>You’ll need to place the fudge in the fridge for at least 2 hours! During this time the fudge will set. Once set, simply cut into small squares and serve!</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
  <li>(1) 14 ounce can sweetened condensed milk</li>
  <li>1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract</li>
  <li>20 ounces semi-sweet chocolate, roughly chopped</li>
  <li>3 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into 1/2-inch pieces, at room temperature</li>
  <li>Flaky sea salt, for sprinkling, optional</li>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Lightly grease an 8 x 8-inch baking pan. Line the pan with parchment paper, allowing the excess paper to overhang the sides, set aside.</li>
  <li>In a large, heatproof bowl combine the sweetened condensed milk, vanilla extract, chocolate, and butter; set aside. Fill a saucepan with a little water (you want it about 1/4 full) and bring it to a boil. Reduce the heat to barely a simmer. Place your heatproof glass bowl holding your ingredients on top of the pot. Stir frequently, until the chocolate has melted and the mixture is completely smooth, about 8 minutes.</li>
  <li>Remove from heat. The mixture will be very thick. Using a sturdy spatula, scrape the fudge into the prepared pan and smooth the top. Sprinkle with sea salt, if using. Refrigerate for at least 2 hours.</li>
  <li>Gently run a butter knife around the edge of the pan to loosen the fudge. Remove the fudge and transfer it to a cutting board.</li>
  <li>Peel off parchment paper, then slice the fudge into small pieces. Serve at once or store in the refrigerator for up to 1 month. You may also freeze the fudge, in an airtight freezer safe container for up to two months.</li>
